                <h2>How to Train People Effectively When You Can't Meet Face-to-Face</h2>

               <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many teams to work from home for the first time. Essential training can't wait for the end of social distancing.
                What's more, as many organizations adapt their approach to survive coronavirus, learning new skills takes on added importance right now. It's better to have something rather than nothing. If all you have for your awareness training program is an annual online training program, then at least you have something. The risk is that you rely on this program as your only touch point and channel to reinforce principles and correct behavior. Some companies have an online orientation program. This should not replace the guide. It should merely supplement the program. 
                Remember, seven different times, seven different ways. If you do have an online training program, it is a good place to get an employee's acknowledgement that they understand their responsibility in properly safeguarding sensitive information at the company. <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-success my-2">Browse books</button>
                <img src="https://www.mindtools.com/media/Resized-Images/Articles/Learning_Skills/23_GI_1181391626_Deagreez_2x1.jpg"><br>This can soften public opinion if and when a data breach occurs. It is better to hear that “the company has an ongoing awareness program and as grievous as the incident may be, it was not because the company was not paying attention to their responsibility to safeguard customers' sensitive information properly.”</span>
                With global teams working across different time zones, and flexible working on the rise, many businesses are already set up for online training. But don't worry if yours isn't one of them. Here, we explore ways to train people effectively when face-to-face isn't an option.</p>
                <span><h1> / Types of Online Training /</h1></span>
                  Online training lets organizations and managers teach people skills and knowledge over the internet via a computer, smartphone, or other device. It can involve:

                  Asynchronous training such as e-learning courses, videos, and facilitated discussion forums, that people can access when they want to.
                  Synchronous or live training where multiple learners take part at the same time, interact with the trainer and one another through virtual classrooms, webinars and online chat tools
